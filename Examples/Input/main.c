/*Taken from Sparkfun/32U4_Breakout_Board on github. */


/* Created 05/22/2012 by Jordan McConnell at Sparkfun Electronics
 * This code is beerware, you know what I'm sayin'?
 *
 * Built on WinXP SP3 and WinAVR-20100110, AVRDUDE 5.10
 *
 * This code is a simple example of digital input for Sparkfun's
 * 32U4 Breakout Board using C and standard AVR libraries.  It
 * teaches you how to read the status of a digital pin to determine
 * whether its current status is HIGH or LOW.
 *
 * Pin PF0 is used as a digital input.  If its status is HIGH,
 * pin PD5 toggles each second, if it's status is LOW, pin PD6
 * toggles each second instead.
 *
 * The user can connect LED's to pins PD5 and PD6 or use a multimeter
 * to verify operation.  If pin PF0 is left unconnected, it's status
 * will be HIGH due to internal pullup resistors, and PD5 toggles.
 * If PF0 is connected to ground, PD6 toggles each second instead.
